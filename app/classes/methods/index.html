            <h1>EcmaScript6 Examples - definition classes</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>
                In object orientation paradigm, methods are messages which make possible the communication among objects. Together with classes EcmaScript 6 has brought the feature of use methods that make part of a class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's see an example:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    var MachineES5 = function(){};

                    MachineES5.prototype.doWork = function(){
                        return "doing ES5";
                    };

                    var machineES5 = new MachineES5();

                    machineES5.doWork();
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="code">
                In EcmaScript 5 to add a method in a function was necessary to use prototype technique where a new function was added inside of function which was almost a class.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    class MachineES6{
                        doWork(){
                            return "doing ES6";
                        }
                    }

                    let machineES6 = new MachineES6();

                    machineES6.doWork();
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="code">
                    In EcmaScript6 the method is declared inside of a class like the other languages that follow the object orientation paradigm. Of course, behind the scene EcmaScript 6 still working with prototype. It's a sugar sintaxe to make the way to write classes and methods easier, but the way to work with prototype of EcmaScript wasn't changed.
