            <p>
                Another feature which came with classes in EcmaScript 6 was inheritance. Now is possible that one class to inherit of another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's see an example:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    class Person{
                        constructor(name){
                            this._name = name;
                        }

                        get name(){
                            return this._name;
                        }

                        set name(value){
                            this._name = value;
                        }
                    }

                    class Employee exyends Person{
                        doWork(){
                            return `${this._name} is working.`
                        }
                    }

                    let employee = new Employee('Rodrigo');

                    employee.name; //=> Rodrigo
                    employee.doWork(); //=> Rodrigo is working.
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="code">
                To a class to inherit from another is necessary to use the keyword "extends" and the class will inherit all attributes, properties, and methods from another class.

                        }

                        get name(){
                            return this._name;
                        }

                        set name(value){

                    class Employee extends Person{
                        constructor(title, name){
                            super(name);
                            this._title = title;

                        }
                    }

                When the class which is inheriting another class has a constructor, but is necessary keep the rules of superclass working is possible to use a method called "super". The method "super" will execute the code of same method, in this case in constructor, in superclass.
